After a set processing time, the relaxer is rinsed out thoroughly, followed by a neutralizing shampoo to stop the chemical process and restore the hair's pH balance.

The process starts with washing, conditioning, and blow-drying the hair to ensure it's clean and smooth for braiding. Next, the hair is sectioned into clean, straight parts using a rat-tail comb and shine-enhancing gel or edge control. The key to stitch braids is creating sharp horizontal lines (or stitches) across each part. This is done by using your fingers or a comb to separate small sections of hair evenly while braiding. Braiding hair extensions are gradually fed in as the stylist braids close to the scalp, helping to create a fuller, longer braid while keeping the stitch pattern neat and uniform. Stitch braids are known for their crisp, eye-catching look and can be styled in various patterns, sizes, and lengths.",
