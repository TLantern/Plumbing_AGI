## üìã Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Basic Scraping
```python
# Simple scraping example
async with SalonWebsiteScraper() as scraper:
    data = await scraper.scrape_salon_website("https://example-salon.com")
    print(f"Found {len(data.services)} services")
```

### Step 2: Database Integration
```python
# Save to database
async with get_db_session() as session:
    location = Location(name=data.business_name, ...)
    session.add(location)
    
    for service in data.services:
        db_service = Service(
            location_id=location.id,
            name=service.name,
            price_cents=service.price_cents,
            duration_min=service.duration_min
        )
        session.add(db_service)
    
    await session.commit()
```

### Step 3: AI Context Update
```python
# Update AI assistant context
ai_context = {
    "services": [service.name for service in data.services],
    "pricing": {service.name: service.price_cents for service in data.services},
    "staff": [prof.name for prof in data.professionals]
}
```

## üîÑ Automation Options

### 1. Scheduled Scraping
```python
# Daily updates
import schedule

def update_salon_data():
    asyncio.run(scrape_and_update_salon())

schedule.every().day.at("02:00").do(update_salon_data)
```

### 2. Webhook Integration
```python
# Real-time updates
@app.post("/webhook/salon-update")
async def handle_salon_update(website_url: str):
    await scrape_and_update_salon(website_url)
    return {"status": "updated"}
```

### 3. Manual Triggers
```python
# Admin interface
@app.post("/admin/refresh-salon-data")
async def refresh_salon_data(location_id: int):
    location = await get_location(location_id)
    await scrape_and_update_salon(location.website_url)
    return {"status": "refreshed"}
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling

### Common Issues
1. **JavaScript-Heavy Sites**: Fallback to HTML parsing
2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement delays between requests
3. **Missing Data**: Graceful degradation with partial data
4. **Network Issues**: Retry logic with exponential backoff

### Monitoring
```python
# Error tracking
try:
    data = await scraper.scrape_salon_website(url)
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Scraping failed for {url}: {e}")
    # Fallback to cached data or manual entry
```

## üîê Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- **No Personal Data**: Only extract public business information

- **Data Retention**: Store only necessary information
- **Access Control**: Secure database access

### Legal Compliance
- **Terms of Service**: Respect website terms
- **Rate Limiting**: Avoid overwhelming servers
- **Data Usage**: Use data only for intended purposes
- **Attribution**: Credit data sources when appropriate
