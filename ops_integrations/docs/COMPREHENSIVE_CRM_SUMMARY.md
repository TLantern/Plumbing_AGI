Detection         Logic          (Completed/No-Show)   & Recommendations
```

## 🎯 **Core CRM Features**

### 1. **Customer Management**

    'customer_phone': '+1234567890',
    'customer_name': 'Aisha',
    'duration_seconds': 180,
    'status': 'completed',  # or 'missed', 'dropped'
    'intent_extracted': 'braids'
})
```

    1: {'start': 7, 'end': 23},   # Tuesday: 7 AM – 11 PM
    2: {'start': 7, 'end': 23},   # Wednesday: 7 AM – 11 PM
    3: {'start': 7, 'end': 23},   # Thursday: 7 AM – 11 PM
    4: {'start': 19, 'end': 23},  # Friday: 7 PM – 11 PM
