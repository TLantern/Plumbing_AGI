## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Name Loading System
```python
# Load Nigerian names from configuration
SALON_NAMES_PATH = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..', 'config', 'boldwings_name.json')
with open(SALON_NAMES_PATH, 'r') as f:
    SALON_NAMES = json.load(f)
    NIGERIAN_NAMES = set(name.lower() for name in SALON_NAMES.get('nigerian_names', []))
```

### Enhanced Name Extraction
```python
def extract_customer_name(text: str) -> str:
    """Extract customer name with Nigerian name priority"""
    
    # 1. Pattern matching (My name is X, I'm X, etc.)
    # 2. Nigerian name recognition with proper capitalization
    # 3. Regular name extraction
    # 4. Fallback to "Customer"
```

### Cultural Greeting Selection

if is_nigerian_name:
    nigerian_greetings = [
        f"Ah, {customer_name}! What a beautiful name, sis! Welcome to Bold Wings.",
        f"Hello {customer_name}! So nice to meet you, queen!",
        f"Welcome {customer_name}, darling! I love your name!",
