As a former basketball player, football player, and youth coach, I love all aspects of sports and have a genuine passion for discussing them and the impact that it has on our youth and society as a whole.
I'm Nathan Monford. I work at the Limited Brands Warehouse. I'm also a student at the Ohio Center for Broadcasting, where I'm learning the art of radio and television production, as well as web design.
I host a sports talk radio show called The Arena, which can be heard every Tuesday, 4 to 6 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, 10 a.m. in Hawaii, on scoreonair.com. Currently, I'm working on developing my website for networking and promoting my show, The Arena.
So to sum it up in five words, I was born for this. Thanks for your time. I'll see you next Tuesday in The Arena. I'm Nathan Monford, hashtag living the dream.
